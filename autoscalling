### **1. What is AWS Auto Scaling?**

**Answer:**
AWS Auto Scaling **automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances** in a group based on demand to ensure performance and cost optimization.

**Answer:**
Yes, but using an ELB ensures traffic is routed to healthy instances.

---

### **9. Does ASG support Spot Instances?**

**Answer:**
Yes, with **Mixed Instance Policies**, ASG can use both On-Demand and Spot instances.

---

### **10. How does ASG ensure fault tolerance?**

**Answer:**

* Replaces unhealthy instances automatically.
* Spreads instances across multiple AZs.

---

### **11. What are lifecycle hooks in ASG?**

**Answer:**
Lifecycle hooks allow **custom actions** (e.g., run scripts, configuration) when instances **launch** or **terminate**.

---

### **12. What is the difference between Dynamic Scaling and Predictive Scaling?**

**Answer:**

* **Dynamic Scaling:** Reacts to real-time metrics.
* **Predictive Scaling:** Uses machine learning to predict future demand.

---

### **13. How do you attach an existing EC2 instance to an ASG?**

**Answer:**

* The instance must have matching configuration.
* Attach using `aws autoscaling attach-instances`.

---

### **14. What is Warm Pool in ASG?**

**Answer:**
Keeps a **pool of pre-initialized instances** to reduce scaling time.

---

### **15. How to ensure zero downtime during scaling operations?**

**Answer:**

* Use **ELB health checks**.
* Use **Rolling Updates**.
* Configure appropriate **cooldown periods**.

---

### **16. What is cooldown in ASG?**

**Answer:**
A period (default 300s) during which ASG **waits before taking another scaling action** to prevent rapid scaling.

---

### **17. Can ASG span multiple Availability Zones (AZs)?**

**Answer:**
Yes, and it’s recommended for **high availability**.

---

### **18. What are Scaling Cooldowns vs Health Check Grace Period?**

**Answer:**

* **Cooldown:** Wait time before another scaling action.
* **Grace Period:** Wait time before checking the health of a newly launched instance.

---

### **19. How do you scale based on custom metrics?**

**Answer:**

* Publish **custom metrics** to CloudWatch.
* Create an alarm on that metric.
* Attach alarm to ASG policy.

---

### **20. How do you use Auto Scaling with ECS (containers)?**

**Answer:**
Use **Service Auto Scaling** to adjust ECS tasks or integrate EC2 ASG with ECS cluster.

---

### **21. Scenario: You need to add instances only during business hours.**

**Answer:**
Use **Scheduled Scaling** to increase/decrease capacity at specific times.

---

### **22. Scenario: Scaling is too aggressive, causing instability.**

**Answer:**

* Increase **cooldown period**.
* Use **Target Tracking** instead of Step Scaling.

---

### **23. Scenario: Instances take too long to become healthy after launch.**

**Answer:**

* Increase **Health Check Grace Period**.
* Use **Warm Pools**.

---

### **24. Scenario: You need to run custom configuration scripts before instances serve traffic.**

**Answer:**
Use **Lifecycle Hooks** (e.g., wait for user data to complete before moving to `InService`).

---

### **25. Scenario: Scaling down terminates the newest instance, but you need oldest first.**

**Answer:**
Change **termination policy** to `OldestInstance`.

---

### **26. What termination policies are available in ASG?**

**Answer:**

* **Default** (oldest instance in oldest AZ)
* **Oldest Instance**
* **Newest Instance**
* **Oldest Launch Configuration**
* **Closest to Next Billing Hour**
* **Custom** (combination)

---

### **27. Scenario: You want ASG to launch both Spot and On-Demand instances.**

**Answer:**
Use **Mixed Instance Policy** in ASG with defined percentages.

---

### **28. Scenario: Users report traffic drops during scaling events.**

**Answer:**

* Check **Load Balancer health check configuration**.
* Use **Connection Draining** / **Deregistration Delay**.

---

### **29. Scenario: Scale based on SQS queue length.**

**Answer:**

* Publish queue length as a CloudWatch metric.
* Attach scaling policy to adjust instance count accordingly.

---

### **30. Scenario: ASG is not scaling as expected.**

**Answer:**

* Check CloudWatch alarms.
* Verify IAM permissions.
* Ensure scaling policies are active.

---

### **31. Scenario: You want to minimize costs while keeping high availability.**

**Answer:**

* Use Spot Instances with On-Demand fallback.
* Use multiple AZs.

---

### **32. Scenario: Ensure ASG works during AZ failure.**

**Answer:**

* Configure ASG with at least **2 AZs**.
* Set minimum capacity >1.

---

### **33. Scenario: You need to stop instances instead of terminating them during scale-in.**

**Answer:**

* Use Lambda triggered by scale-in lifecycle hook to stop instances.

---

### **34. Scenario: Need to control scaling behavior using machine learning.**

**Answer:**
Use **Predictive Scaling** with AWS Auto Scaling.

---

### **35. Scenario: Instances keep terminating due to health check failures.**

**Answer:**

* Check **User Data** script.
* Increase **Health Check Grace Period**.
* Verify load balancer health check path.

---

### **36. Scenario: Run different instance types in the same ASG.**

**Answer:**
Use **Launch Template with multiple instance types**.

---

### **37. Scenario: New instances must register with a configuration management tool before serving traffic.**

Implement **Lifecycle Hook** with SNS/Lambda to complete registration.

---

### **38. Scenario: How to test ASG scaling policies safely?**

**Answer:**

* Use **manual scaling** first.
* Use **test metrics** with temporary alarms.

---

### **39. Scenario: You need to ensure scaling policies do not conflict.**
